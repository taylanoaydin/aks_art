# aks_art

This repository contains the code (both for the AKS algorithm implementation and art generation) that I developed for a research project years ago. One of the resulting generated artpieces that captured primality patterns in natural numbers have been used as a cover of MAA Focus magazine, for their 2021 June-July issue seen below.
